		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or

			secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
			guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
			unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or

		<p class="paragraph">
			Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
			feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
			browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
			implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
			other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
			tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
			version of this privacy notice.
